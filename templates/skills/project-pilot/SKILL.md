# ProjectPilot

Authority: follow `core-rules/AGENTS.md`, the active ticket APC, Phase Gate,
and project rules.

Use this skill when the task involves any of the following:

- multi-language feature or behavior changes
- protocol, serialization, transport, codec, or table lane work
- generated/runtime/report contract drift
- fallback, alias, helper, no-op, placeholder, or silent stub cleanup
- metadata, manifest, schema, generated-artifact, or report contract bypass
  cleanup
- convention, naming, file layout, factory surface, or lifecycle unification
- repeated failure families where one local fix would hide shared contract drift

## Micro-Protocol

1. Read local project rules and architecture constraints first.
2. Create or select the active ticket and record ProjectPilot scope before editing.
3. Define the refactor contract before proposing or making edits.
4. Build the implementation matrix across the relevant surfaces.
5. Classify drift as `C`, `P`, `S`, `B`, `U`, or `D`.
6. Identify source owners before touching source, generated, runtime, report,
   or template files.
7. Identify metadata/manifest/schema contract bypasses before accepting
   generated-output evidence.
8. Fill the drift checklist and reject shortcuts that hide drift.
9. Define the conformance gate in the ticket without creating tests unless the
   user requested tests.
10. Only then split remediation tickets or implement scoped changes.

## Required Outputs

- Implementation Matrix
- Refactor Contract
- Flow Contract
- Integration Contract
- Owner Map
- Drift Checklist
- Conformance Gate
- Remediation Plan

Use the shared ProjectPilot semantics and templates when available:

- `docs/PROJECT_PILOT.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX_TEMPLATE.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/REFACTOR_CONTRACT_TEMPLATE.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/FLOW_CONTRACT_TEMPLATE.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_TEMPLATE.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/OWNER_MAP_TEMPLATE.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/DRIFT_CHECKLIST.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/CONFORMANCE_GATE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `templates/project-pilot/REMEDIATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`

Consumer projects may keep only project-local pilot evidence and references.
Shared ProjectPilot semantics and templates are owned by DeukAgentFlow.

## Stop Conditions

- No active ticket or no approval boundary for refactor-contract work.
- No implementation matrix or refactor contract can be stated clearly.
- Source-of-truth owner cannot be identified.
- A fix depends on generated direct edits or hidden fallback.
- A provider, generator, template, or report path hardcodes values that belong in
  metadata, a manifest, schema contract, or shared conformance rule.
- Unsupported-by-contract and broken-entrypoint are not separated.
- Verification cannot prove the claimed alignment.
