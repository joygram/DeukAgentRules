**한국어:** [CHANGELOG.ko.md](CHANGELOG.ko.md)

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **cli:** stop ticket discovery at the current agent-rule boundary instead of inheriting the parent workspace.

## [4.0.38] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- **rules:** require approval-pending final answers to repeat the compact `Ticket start` surface, preventing final-only approval text from hiding the active ticket link.

## [4.0.37] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **init:** restore a visible completion message after successful init and add the short first-use prompt guide ``이슈분석 티켓`이라고 해보세요.``

## [4.0.36] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **init:** reduce first-run interactive setup to the workspace-purpose choice, infer the remaining defaults from the project directory, hide the Deuk AgentContext MCP choice, and avoid the post-choice stall that prevented setup completion.
- **rules:** require the clickable `Ticket start` line to stay visible after first ticket creation/use, preventing approval-only replies from hiding the active ticket.

## [4.0.35] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **release:** make public package publish scripts skip source-only tests while still running the npm smoke check.
- **release:** require public commit subjects to describe the released feature, fix, docs, or release change instead of using `sync` as the main label.
- **release:** print the same public commit-message guidance from the export script so public history records product changes rather than transport mechanics.

## [4.0.34] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- **init:** redesigned first-run prompts around workspace kind, technical surface, AI client pointers, and optional Deuk AgentContext MCP memory so non-coding and mixed workspaces are not forced into a coding-only setup.
- **docs:** simplified user-facing update instructions to `npm install -g deuk-agent-flow` followed by `deuk-agent-flow init`, with repo-root and workspace-root refresh guidance.

### Fixed

- **templates:** made package `templates/` the runtime SSoT and removed legacy `.deuk-agent/templates` copies during init/merge.
- **ticket:** normalized common Phase 1 heading-level mistakes during `ticket create` before strict template validation.
- **release:** narrowed public export to runtime files and cleaned stale release-tree artifacts such as old tarballs, `bundle/`, `node_modules/`, internal scripts, and tests.

## [4.0.21] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **docs:** repaired the custom downloads badge endpoint payload so Shields accepts it, and restored the combined `deuk-flow` downloads badge at the top of the English and Korean README surfaces.
- **release:** copied `docs/badges/npm-downloads.json` into the public release tree and removed internal-only package payload leakage from the npm release surface.

## [4.0.20] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **docs:** restored the combined npm downloads badge to the top of the English and Korean README surfaces while keeping the public `deuk-flow` label.
- **release:** copied `docs/badges/` into the public release tree so the README downloads badge survives public export and patch republish flow.

## [4.0.12] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **init:** preserve AgentFlow spokes during migration by replacing installed legacy `CLAUDE.md` surfaces without creating `.bak` files, while still installing a default root `AGENTS.md` pointer for `.deuk-agent` projects without detected agent tool surfaces.
- **skill:** report installed skills from either the registry or on-disk `.deuk-agent/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` files so `deuk-agent-flow skill list` reflects migrated skill directories.
- **rules:** map AgentFlow skill-status questions to `deuk-agent-flow skill list` and use fully qualified `deuk-agent-flow ticket ...` command examples in the core agent rules.

## [4.0.11] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **init/ticket:** restore the intended month-only archive policy by normalizing older deep archive layouts into the canonical month bucket layout, rebuilding archive shard indexes without obsolete archive-depth metadata, and preventing new non-canonical imports during `init`.

## [3.3.3] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Restored the README language switch links so npm and GitHub readers can move between English and Korean documentation from the first screen.
- Published only public documentation links in the README tables while keeping internal research and growth notes out of the npm/Public surface.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-05-06

### Positioning

- Reframed the npm/GitHub identity around **AI coding agent guardrails for every repo**, with ticketed scope, verification, and shared `AGENTS.md` workflows visible in package metadata.
- Added README comparison against `AGENTS.md`, Copilot instructions, Cursor rules, Claude skills, agent harnesses, and general guardrail frameworks to show where DeukAgentFlow sits in the ecosystem.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-25

### 🚀 Major Breakthrough: Hub-Spoke Architecture
- **Canonical Rule Hub**: Introduced `AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth for all AI agents.
- **Thin Spoke Pointers**: IDE-specific rules (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) are now lightweight pointers to the central Hub, eliminating duplication and sync errors.
- **Global CLI Proxy**: Implemented a smart entry point that automatically detects and routes execution to local workspace sources, ensuring zero-latency development.

### 🧹 Zero-Legacy & Cleanliness
- **Auto-Purge**: `init` now unconditionally deletes deprecated `.cursorrules` files.
- **Smart Backups**: Added logic to detect custom user rules and rename files to `.bak` instead of deletion.
- **Submodule Scrubbing**: Automatically cleans empty submodule directory stubs and scrubs `.gitmodules`.

### 🏗️ Branding & Infrastructure
- **Identity Overhaul**: Rebranded as a "Zero-Latency, High-Signal AI Orchestration Protocol".
- **Documentation v3**: New high-end 3D visual infographics and overhauled conceptual guides (Architecture, Principles, How-it-works).
- **Domain Agnostic**: Generalized `bundle/AGENTS.md` to support any technology stack, removing domain-specific hardcoding.

### ⚙️ CLI Enhancements
- **Proxy Routing**: `bin/deuk-agent-rule.js` performs directory traversal to find local scripts.
- **Synchronized IO**: Refactored core logic to use synchronous FS operations for rock-solid CLI stability.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-18
- add Codex CLI support (.codexrules) and apply globally
- implement ticket chaining (--chain) for automated ticket linkage
- improve submodule isolation logic
## [4.0.19] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **publish:** restore generated spoke replacement during init so legacy DeukAgentRules pointers do not survive beside the new DeukAgentFlow managed block
- **telemetry:** switch client-label normalization to the shared `toSlug` utility so architecture guard tests pass during release validation

### Changed

- **docs:** align the English and Korean maintainer publish sections around the dual-package npm flow and the combined downloads badge

## [4.0.18] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **skills:** preserve `.deuk-agent/skills.json` and `usage.json` during init layout cleanup, and let `skill list` detect real Claude/Cursor exposure pointers even when registry state is stale
- **telemetry:** normalize model/client labels so analytics do not fragment across case and spacing variants
- **ticket:** prefer the newest open ticket when syncing the active ticket pointer so `ticket continue` follows the current work instead of an older open ticket
