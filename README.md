**Deuk Agent Flow** is the repo-owned workflow layer for AI-assisted workspaces: planning, software engineering, systems work, research, and operations can enter the same ticketed flow through Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini, Windsurf, or the next agent you adopt.

Most agent setups stop at instructions. Deuk Agent Flow turns short chat into an operating loop: ticket, scope, execute, verify, archive. It keeps `AGENTS.md`, Copilot instructions, Cursor rules, Claude skills, and related agent surfaces aligned without asking you to type long commands.

The hook is simple: you can say "next", "inspect", or "clean this up", and the current agent has a repo-owned place to know what that means. Active work lives in `.deuk-agent/tickets/`; decisions, plans, and closeout evidence stay with the codebase instead of vanishing into a chat transcript. **Deuk Agent Flow** is the workflow layer. Plug that flow into the separate companion product **Deuk AgentContext**, and the whole repo gains an expanded project brain: searchable memory, reusable decisions, and team patterns the next agent can actually use.

### Why Now

AI coding has crossed from novelty into production volume:

- Google says **75% of its new code is AI-generated**, up from 25% in 2024 and 50% last fall. ([Semafor, 2026](https://www.semafor.com/article/04/24/2026/google-ceo-says-75-of-companys-new-code-is-ai-generated))
- Sonar's 2026 developer survey coverage reports AI-generated code at about **42% today**, with developers expecting roughly **65% by 2027**. ([TechRadar, 2026](https://www.techradar.com/pro/devs-dont-trust-ai-code-but-many-say-they-still-dont-check-it-anyways))
- Stack Overflow's 2025 survey coverage found **84%** of developers use or plan to use AI tools, while "almost right" output and debugging AI code are top frustrations. ([InfoWorld, 2025](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4031673/ai-use-among-software-developers-grows-but-trust-remains-an-issue-stack-overflow-survey.html))
- Faros reported the uncomfortable tradeoff: more completed work, but **54% more bugs per developer**, review time up fivefold, and more incidents per PR. ([ADTmag, 2026](https://adtmag.com/articles/2026/04/22/more-code-more-bugs.aspx))

The new bottleneck is not typing code. It is keeping agent work scoped, reviewable, verified, and recoverable.

### What Changes With Deuk Agent Flow

| Without it | With Deuk Agent Flow |
|---|---|
| "Continue" depends on chat memory | "Next" resolves through repo tickets |
| Agent edits can drift outside the ask | APC scope defines what can change |
| Reviewers see code but not intent | Tickets keep cause, plan, and evidence beside the code |
| AI output adds review load | Verification and closeout are part of the work loop |
| Context dies when the chat ends | Archive + knowledge distillation preserve the project memory |

### One-Minute View

```text
Short chat
  "next" / "inspect" / "ship it"
        |
        v
Deuk Agent Flow
  ticket + scope + verification + memory
        |
        v
Repo-owned work
  reviewable changes + durable decisions + next-session continuity
```

| Benefit | What you feel |
|---|---|
| Less context loss | The next agent can continue without replaying the whole chat |
| Less scope drift | The ticket says what can and cannot change |
| Less review guesswork | Intent and evidence sit beside the diff |
| Less generated-code risk | Source/generator ownership is checked before edits |
| Better team memory | Completed work becomes searchable project history |

> **Current readiness:**
> v4.0.0 is deployment-ready for agent-driven repositories. It is currently most reliable in **OpenAI Codex** and **GitHub Copilot** workflows. Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code remain supported through pointer-style integration, but they should be validated per workspace before rollout. Deuk AgentContext MCP is an optional memory layer; MCP server registration is separate from `init`.
> **Architecture foundation:**
> We have officially deprecated monolithic `.cursorrules`. v3.0 introduces the **Hub-Spoke model** where `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth, and IDE-specific rules act as thin entry-point pointers.

### 🗺️ Main Features & Architecture

Deuk Agent Flow brings four core capabilities to day-to-day AI engineering:

1. **Zero-Copy Hub-Spoke Architecture**
   - **Hub**: `AGENTS.md` acts as the global single source of truth.
   - **Spoke**: IDE-specific rules (like `.cursorrules`) or `PROJECT_RULE.md` act as thin pointers.
   - **Benefit**: Eliminates rule duplication, preventing conflicting instructions and context hallucination across different IDEs (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf).

2. **Ticket-Driven Workflow (TDW)**
   - Guides work through a clear lifecycle: Plan → Execute → Verify → Archive.
   - Keeps changes connected to an active ticket in `.deuk-agent/tickets/`, so scope and progress stay visible.

3. **Platform Co-existence & Mode-Aware Workflow Gate**
   - Uses strong Agent Permission Contracts (APC) through a **Mode-Aware** workflow.
   - In **Plan Mode**, agents focus on analysis and planning artifacts before moving into approved execution.
   - Integrates with MCP Soft Gates to keep code changes aligned with the current ticket context.

4. **Zero-Token Knowledge Distillation**
   - When a ticket is archived, it is distilled into a zero-token summary and moved to `reports/`.
   - These reports are vectorized into DeukAgentContext, building a permanent Engineering Memory Engine without cluttering the agent's active context window.

### Why Not Just Instructions?

The agent tooling space already has useful building blocks: `AGENTS.md`, GitHub Copilot instructions, Cursor rules, Claude skills, agent launchers, and general LLM guardrail frameworks. Deuk Agent Flow is positioned one layer above plain instruction sync: it turns those surfaces into a ticketed repository workflow.

| Similar approach | What it helps with | Deuk Agent Flow adds |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` open format | A predictable instruction file for coding agents | Ticket lifecycle, phase gates, verification, and archiveable memory |
| Copilot instructions / Cursor rules / Claude memory | Tool-specific guidance | One repo-owned workflow shared across agent clients |
| Claude or Copilot custom agents and skills | Reusable task playbooks | Skills route into scoped, ticketed execution instead of replacing the workflow |
| Agent launchers and harnesses | Running many coding agents from one place | Lifecycle control inside the repository, independent of the chosen agent |
| General LLM/MCP guardrails | Runtime policy checks for AI systems | Developer-facing work orders, scope contracts, Git-visible history, and closeout evidence |

Use Deuk Agent Flow when you want AI coding work to stay coordinated, reviewable, and easy to carry forward across sessions and teammates.

### Better Together With Karpathy-Style Skills

Karpathy-style skills are great at improving how an agent behaves inside a task. Deuk Agent Flow is great at making that task ticketed, scoped, verified, and remembered at the repository level.

Used together, skills can improve the quality of the move, while Deuk Agent Flow keeps the move connected to team workflow. The result is a better session and a better project record: behavior playbooks on the front end, ticket lifecycle and DeukAgentContext memory on the back end.

### What's Next

The next step is to make this flow even easier to see and adopt: clearer first-run checks, compact CLI/RAG reminders for agents, stronger README/npm positioning, and companion surfaces that show active ticket, phase, open-ticket count, and DeukAgentContext memory status without asking teams to switch coding agents.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Global Installation (Standard User)
To prevent `npx` cache issues and "Local Traps", a global installation is strictly required.

```bash
npm install -g deuk-agent-flow
deuk-agent-flow init
```

To apply a newly installed version to an existing repo, update the global package first and then rerun init:

```bash
npm install -g deuk-agent-flow
deuk-agent-flow init --workflow execute
```

`init` reapplies the currently installed package rules and removes legacy runtime template copies. It does not update the global npm package by itself.

For a single repo, run `deuk-agent-flow init --workflow execute` from that repo root.

For a root workspace that contains multiple DeukAgentFlow projects, run the same command from the workspace root. `init` updates the root pointer and discovered child workspaces that own their own `PROJECT_RULE.md` / `.deuk-agent/` state, so ordinary users can refresh their AI agent rules from their personal workspace root after installing a new package version.

Agent client pointers are not a one-time decision. If you start using another client later, rerun `deuk-agent-flow init --workflow execute` and select the additional AI client.

This is where the effect compounds: use the workspace root as the shared entry point, each project root as an independent ticket/rule/verification boundary, and nested apps or servers as separate projects only when they have their own lifecycle.

### 2. Local Source Development (Maintainer/Power User)
The global command runs the installed package by default. If you are developing against a local checkout from another project directory, opt into local source routing explicitly.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/DeukAgentFlow
sudo npm link
DEUK_AGENT_FLOW_USE_LOCAL=1 deuk-agent-flow init  # Routes to local scripts/cli.mjs
```

If you primarily work in Codex or Copilot, this is the recommended day-to-day setup. Those clients currently have the smoothest behavior with the hub-spoke and ticket-driven workflow.

### 3. Maintainer Publish
Maintainers can publish from the root command:

```bash
npm run publish
```

This flow must register both npm packages in one run under the `deuk-flow` release surface:

- `deuk-flow` canonical package: `deuk-agent-flow`
- `deuk-flow` legacy compatibility alias package: `deuk-agent-rule`

The publish script syncs the alias package version/dependency first, then publishes the canonical package before the alias package.

Use dry-run mode before writing to the npm registry:

```bash
npm run publish:dry
```

Before publishing, run the Docker consumer smoke test. It installs the packed packages into a clean Node container, so local `npm link` or global packages cannot hide missing dependencies.

```bash
npm run smoke:npm:docker
```

After publish, refresh the combined downloads badge when needed:

```bash
npm run badge:downloads
```

The badge should display `deuk-flow` while still summing downloads from both `deuk-agent-flow` and `deuk-agent-rule`.

## 🎯 The Protocol Workflow

The workflow is governed by a **Ticket-Driven Execution Contract**.

1. **Scaffolding**: `init` deploys `AGENTS.md` and local pointers like `PROJECT_RULE.md`; runtime templates come from the package `templates/` SSoT, not `.deuk-agent/templates/`.
2. **Ticketing (Plan Phase)**: The user describes the work in natural language, and the agent turns it into a bounded work order in `.deuk-agent/tickets/`. During this phase, agents operate in **Plan Mode** and are restricted from mutating files.
3. **Execution (Execute Phase)**: Once authorized, the AI agent reads the ticket, locks onto the **Target Submodule**, and executes code changes. MCP Soft Gates ensure that unauthorized modifications are blocked.
4. **Verification**: The agent performs a side-effect audit and convention (e.g., DC-DUP) check before closure.
5. **Archiving (Archive Phase)**: Completed tickets undergo Zero-Token Knowledge Distillation and move to `reports/` to build the **Engineering Memory Engine** via DeukAgentContext.

## ⚙️ Agent Requests

Ask your AI agent in plain language. The CLI commands are the agent's execution layer, not something the user has to type during normal collaboration.

| What you want | Say something like |
|--------|------|
| Start a scoped task | *"티켓 잡고 진행"* |
| Continue existing work | *"다음 진행"* |
| Review before coding | *"원인 먼저 파악"* |
| Finish and preserve context | *"검증 기록하고 정리"* |
| Manage skills | *"safe-refactor 추가"* |

### Ticket File Git Hygiene

- Treat `.deuk-agent/tickets/**/*.md` and `INDEX*.json` as CLI-managed lifecycle artifacts.
- Do not commit a ticket body without the related index updates. The next session can restore the wrong active/archive state.
- After `ticket create` fails, do not create or repair ticket files manually.
- Do not flip ticket status by editing frontmatter directly. Use `ticket move`, `ticket close`, or `ticket archive`.
- `telemetry.jsonl` is usually operational log noise, so it is better left out of normal code commits unless your repo intentionally tracks it.
- When possible, commit completed work after `ticket archive` so the active/archive transition lands in one history step.

For maintainers and automation, the underlying CLI still exposes commands such as `deuk-agent-flow ticket create`, `ticket move`, and `ticket archive`.

## Related Ideas & Inspiration

Deuk Agent Flow shares the same concern as guideline-first projects like
[andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills):
AI coding agents often over-assume, over-engineer, and edit outside the requested scope.

Where prompt-level guideline files improve agent behavior inside one client,
Deuk Agent Flow adds a repository-level workflow layer: tickets, phase gates,
scoped permissions, verification, and archiveable engineering memory.

The first-party skill MVP keeps that boundary explicit: skills are short
`SKILL.md` playbooks for recurring failure patterns, while `core-rules/AGENTS.md`
remains the workflow authority. Use `skill add` and `skill expose` to make those
playbooks visible to Claude or Cursor without copying the full rule contract.

Skill availability:

- Synced by `init`: all first-party skill templates are copied into `.deuk-agent/skill-templates/`.
- Recommended default install: `safe-refactor`, `generated-file-guard`.
- Optional install: `context-recall`, `project-pilot`.

Current first-party skills:

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `safe-refactor` | Default recommended: keep refactors small, scoped, and test-backed |
| `generated-file-guard` | Default recommended: avoid direct edits to generated outputs |
| `context-recall` | Optional: reuse prior ticket/rule memory without making RAG the source of truth |
| `project-pilot` | Optional: control cross-language, protocol, generated/runtime drift refactors |

```bash
npx deuk-agent-flow init
npx deuk-agent-flow skill list
npx deuk-agent-flow skill add --skill safe-refactor
npx deuk-agent-flow skill add --skill generated-file-guard
npx deuk-agent-flow skill add --skill project-pilot
npx deuk-agent-flow skill expose --platform claude
```
